# ChunkWars
Chunk Wars is a team-based attack-defense minigame for Minecraft.  You'll be flung into a chunk-based arena with your team, where you will face everything that vanilla Minecraft can throw at you. Your goal is to work out how to use it in a PvP context - to take out your opponents' bed and be the last team standing.

This repository contains the datapack and the issue tracker for Chunk Wars, to enable me to work publicly and collaboratively on the map. Chunk Wars is currently in limited private testing, so the world files for the minigame are not yet available for download.
