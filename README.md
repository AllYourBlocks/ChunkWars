# ChunkWars
Chunk Wars is a team-based attack-defense minigame for Minecraft.  You'll be flung into a chunk-based arena with your team, where you will face everything that vanilla Minecraft can throw at you. Your goal is to work out how to use it in a PvP context - to take out your opponents' bed and be the last team standing.
