# Chunk Wars

=======

Chunk Wars is a team-based attack-defend minigame for Minecraft.  You play in an arena of unique Chunks, all carefully handcrafted to replicate different Minecraft biomes and structures as closely as possible.

Along with your team you will face everything that vanilla Minecraft can throw at you. Your goal is to work out how best to gear up and use Minecraft's resources in a PvP context - to take out your opponents' bed and be the last team standing.

This repository contains the datapack and the issue tracker for Chunk Wars, to enable me to work publicly and collaboratively on the map. Chunk Wars is currently in limited private testing, so the world files for the minigame are not yet available for download.
